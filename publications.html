						Cellular automata (CA) are a class of computational models that exhibit rich dynamics emerging from the local interaction of cells arranged in a regular lattice. 
						In this work we focus on a generalised version of typical CA, called graph cellular automata (GCA), in which the lattice structure is replaced by an arbitrary graph. 
						In particular, we extend previous work that used convolutional neural networks to learn the transition rule of conventional CA and we use graph neural networks to learn a variety of transition rules for GCA. 
						First, we present a general-purpose architecture for learning GCA, and we show that it can represent any arbitrary GCA with finite and discrete state space. 
						Then, we test our approach on three different tasks: 1) learning the transition rule of a GCA on a Voronoi tessellation; 2) imitating the behaviour of a group of flocking agents; 3) learning a rule that converges to a desired target state.

						 Temporal-Difference off-policy algorithms are among the building blocks of reinforcement learning (RL). Within this family, Q-Learning is arguably the most famous one, which has been widely studied and extended. The update rule of Q-learning involves the use of the maximum operator to estimate the maximum expected value of the return. However, this estimate is positively biased, and may hinder the learning process, especially in stochastic environments and when function approximation is used. We introduce the Weighted Estimator as an effective solution to mitigate the negative effects of overestimation in Q-Learning. The Weighted Estimator estimates the maximum expected value as a weighted sum of the action values, with the weights being the probabilities that each action value is the maximum. In this work, we study the problem from the statistical perspective of estimating the maximum expected value of a set of random variables and provide bounds to the bias and the variance of the Weighted Estimator, showing its advantages over other estimators present in literature. Then, we derive algorithms to enable the use of the Weighted Estimator, in place of the Maximum Estimator, in online and batch RL, and we introduce a novel algorithm for deep RL. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithms in a large set of heterogeneous problems, encompassing discrete and continuous, low and high dimensional, deterministic and stochastic environments. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the Weighted Estimator in controlling the bias of the estimate, resulting in better performance than representative baselines and robust learning w.r.t. a large set of diverse environments.

						 Inspired by the conventional pooling layers in convolutional neural networks, many recent works in the field of graph machine learning have introduced pooling operators to reduce the size of graphs. The great variety in the literature stems from the many possible strategies for coarsening a graph, which may depend on different assumptions on the graph structure or the specific downstream task. In this paper we propose a formal characterization of graph pooling based on three main operations, called selection, reduction, and connection, with the goal of unifying the literature under a common framework. Following this formalization, we introduce a taxonomy of pooling operators and categorize more than thirty pooling methods proposed in recent literature. We propose criteria to evaluate the performance of a pooling operator and use them to investigate and contrast the behavior of different classes of the taxonomy on a variety of tasks.

						 Dealing with missing values and incomplete time series is a labor-intensive and time-consuming inevitable task when handling data coming from real-world applications. Effective spatio-temporal representations would allow imputation methods to reconstruct missing temporal data by exploiting information coming from sensors at different locations. However, standard methods fall short in capturing the nonlinear time and space dependencies existing within networks of interconnected sensors and do not take full advantage of the available - and often strong - relational information. Notably, most of state-of-the-art imputation methods based on deep learning do not explicitly model relational aspects and, in any case, do not exploit processing frameworks able to adequately represent structured spatio-temporal data. Conversely, graph neural networks have recently surged in popularity as both expressive and scalable tools for processing sequential data with relational inductive biases. In this work, we present the first assessment of graph neural networks in the context of multivariate time series imputation. In particular, we introduce a novel graph neural network architecture, named GRIL, which aims at reconstructing missing data in the different channels of a multivariate time series by learning spatial-temporal representations through message passing. Preliminary empirical results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the imputation task on relevant benchmarks with mean absolute error improvements often higher than 20%.

                       While graph neural networks have made impressive progress in classification and regression on graphs, few approaches to date perform time series prediction on graphs and those that do are mostly limited to edge changes. We suggest that graph edits are a more natural interface for graph-to-graph learning. In particular,  graph edits are general enough to describe any graph-to-graph change, not only edge changes, they are sparse, making them easier to understand for humans and more efficient computationally, and they are local, avoiding the need for pooling layers in graph neural networks. In this paper, we propose a simple linear layer - the graph edit network - which takes node embeddings as input and generates a sequence of graph edits that transform the input graph to the output graph. Theoretically, we show that a mapping between the node sets of two graphs is sufficient to construct training data for a graph edit network and that an optimal mapping yields edit scripts that are almost as short as the graph edit distance between the graphs. We further provide a proof-of-concept.

						Graph neural networks (GNNs) and the attention mechanism are two of the most significant advances in artificial intelligence methods over the past few years. The former are neural networks able to process graph-structured data, while the latter learns to selectively focus on those parts of the input that are more relevant for the task at hand. In this paper, we propose a methodology for seizure localisation which combines the two approaches.
						Our method is composed of several blocks. First, we represent brain states in a compact way by computing functional networks from intracranial electroencephalography recordings, using metrics to quantify the coupling between the activity of different brain areas. Then, we train a GNN to correctly distinguish between functional networks associated with interictal and ictal phases. The GNN is equipped with an attention-based layer which automatically learns to identify those regions of the brain (associated with individual electrodes) that are most important for a correct classification. The localisation of these regions is fully unsupervised, meaning that it does not use any prior information regarding the seizure onset zone.
						We report results both for human patients and for simulators of brain activity. We show that the regions of interest identified by the GNN strongly correlate with the localisation of the seizure onset zone reported by electroencephalographers. We also show that our GNN exhibits uncertainty on those patients for which the clinical localisation was also unsuccessful, highlighting the robustness of the proposed approach.

						In recent years, the machine learning community has seen a continuous growing interest in research aimed at investigating dynamical aspects of both training procedures and perfected models. Of particular interest among recurrent neural networks, we have the Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm for its conceptual simplicity and fast training scheme. Yet, the guiding principles under which RC operates are only partially understood. In this work, we study the properties behind learning dynamical systems with RC and propose a new guiding principle based on Generalized Synchronization (GS) granting its feasibility. We show that the well-known Echo State Property (ESP) implies and is implied by GS, so that theoretical results derived from the ESP still hold when GS does. However, by using GS one can profitably study the RC learning procedure by linking the reservoir dynamics with the readout training. Notably, this allows us to shed light on the interplay between the input encoding performed by the reservoir and the output produced by the readout optimized for the task at hand. In addition, we show that - as opposed to the ESP - satisfaction of the GS can be measured by means of the Mutual False Nearest Neighbors index, which makes effective to practitioners theoretical derivations.

						Reservoir computing is a popular approach to design recurrent neural networks, due to its training simplicity and its approximation performance. The recurrent part of these networks is not trained (e.g. via gradient descent), making them appealing for analytical studies, raising the interest of a vast community of researcher spanning from dynamical systems to neuroscience. It emerges that, even in the simple linear case, the working principle of these networks is not fully understood and the applied research is usually driven by heuristics. A novel analysis of the dynamics of such networks is proposed, which allows one to express the state evolution using the controllability matrix. Such a matrix encodes salient characteristics of the network dynamics: in particular, its rank can be used as an input-indepedent measure of the memory of the network. Using the proposed approach, it is possible to compare different architectures and explain why a cyclic topology achieves favourable results.

						 Management and efficient operations in critical infrastructure such as Smart Grids take huge advantage of accurate power load forecasting which, due to its nonlinear nature, remains a challenging task. Recently, deep learning has emerged in the machine learning field achieving impressive performance in a vast range of tasks, from image classification to machine translation. Applications of deep learning models to the electric load forecasting problem are gaining interest among researchers as well as the industry, but a comprehensive and sound comparison among different architectures is not yet available in the literature. This work aims at filling the gap by reviewing and experimentally evaluating on two real-world datasets the most recent trends in electric load forecasting, by contrasting deep learning architectures on short term forecast (one day ahead prediction). Specifically, we focus on feedforward and recurrent neural networks, sequence to sequence models and temporal convolutional neural networks along with architectural variants, which are known in the signal processing community but are novel to the load forecasting one.

						 Overestimation of the maximum action-value is a well-known problem that hinders Q-Learning performance, leading to suboptimal policies and unstable learning. Among several Q-Learning variants proposed to address this issue, Weighted Q-Learning (WQL) effectively reduces the bias and shows remarkable results in stochastic environments. WQL uses a weighted sum of the estimated action-values, where the weights correspond to the probability of each action-value being the maximum; however, the computation of these probabilities is only practical in the tabular settings. In this work, we provide the methodological advances to benefit from the WQL properties in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), by using neural networks with Dropout Variational Inference as an effective approximation of deep Gaussian processes. In particular, we adopt the Concrete Dropout variant to obtain calibrated estimates of epistemic uncertainty in DRL. We show that model uncertainty in DRL can be useful not only for action selection, but also action evaluation. We analyze how the novel Weighted Deep Q-Learning algorithm reduces the bias wrt relevant baselines and provide empirical evidence of its advantages on several representative benchmarks.

During training, the GNN learns new representations for the vertices and fits them to a pyramid of coarsened graphs, which is computed in a pre-processing step. As theoretical contributions, we first demonstrate the equivalence between the MAXCUT partition and the node decimation procedure on which NDP is based. Then, we propose a procedure to sparsify the coarsened graphs for reducing the computational complexity in the GNN; we also demonstrate that it is possible to drop many edges without significantly altering the graph spectra of coarsened graphs.

						 Highly accurate power demand forecasting represents one of key challenges of Smart Grid applications. In this setting, a large number of Smart Meters produces huge amounts of data that need to be processed to predict the load requested by the grid. Due to the high dimensionality of the problem, this often results in the adoption of simple aggregation strategies for the power that fail in capturing the relational information existing among the different types of user. A possible alternative, known as Cluster-based Aggregate Forecasting, consists in clustering the load profiles and, on top of that, building predictors of the aggregate at the cluster-level. In this work we explore the technique in the context of predictors based on deep recurrent neural networks and address the scalability issues presenting neural architectures adequate to process cluster-level aggregates. The proposed methods are finally evaluated both on a publicly available benchmark and a heterogenous dataset of Smart Meter data from an entire, medium-sized, Swiss town.

                        Given a finite sequence of graphs, we propose a methodology to identify possible changes in stationarity in the stochastic process that generated such graphs. We consider a general family of attributed graphs for which both topology (vertices and edges) and associated attributes are allowed to change over time, without violating the stationarity hypothesis. Novel Change-Point Methods (CPMs) are proposed that map graphs onto vectors, apply a suitable statistical test in vector space and detect changes –if any– according to a user-defined confidence level; an estimate for the change point is provided as well. We ground our methods on theoretical results that show how the inference in the numerical vector space is related to the one in graph domain, and vice-versa.

						We focus on the problem of detecting changes in stationarity in a stream of attributed graphs. To this end, we introduce a novel change detection framework based on neural networks and Constant-curvature manifolds (CCMs), that takes into account the non-Euclidean nature of graphs. Our contribution in this work is twofold. First, via a novel approach based on adversarial learning, we compute graph embeddings by training an autoencoder to represent graphs on CCMs. Second, we introduce two novel change detection tests operating on CCMs.

						We propose binary echo state networks (ESNs), which are architecturally equivalent to standard ESNs but consider binary activation functions and binary recurrent weights. For these networks, we derive a closed-form expression for the edge of criticality (EoC) in the autonomous case and perform simulations in order to assess their behavior in the case of noisy neurons and in the presence of a signal. We propose a theoretical explanation for the fact that the variance of the input plays a major role in characterizing the EoC.

						We investigate how embedding graphs on constant-curvature manifolds (hyper-spherical and hyperbolic manifolds) impacts on the ability to detect changes in sequences of attributed graphs. The proposed methodology consists in embedding graphs into a geometric space and perform change detection there by means of conventional methods for numerical streams.

						 We consider stochastic processes generating graphs and propose a methodology for detecting changes in stationarity of such processes. The methodology acts by embedding every graph of the stream into a vector domain, where a conventional multivariate change detection procedure can be easily applied. We ground the soundness of our proposal by proving several theoretical results.
